v7.0.0 (July 29, 2021)
	- NEW: Added Tint & Object Spell Support
	- NEW: Object Group Support (Automatic)
	- NEW: Automatic Dimension Detection for M2's
	- NEW: Auto Update mode for Object Parameters (Will auto fill selected objects ID, Scale, and if it's an M2, the dimensions as well)
	- NEW: Auto Show option - Toggle on to automatically show ObjectMover when you load in
	- NEW: Fade Out option - Toggle on to fade ObjectMover to be less distracting when not in immediate use
	- UPDATED: Scale Object now works with Macro Spawning instead of delayed scale commands (No Delay, No Desync)
	- UPDATED: Scale Object now applies to the selected object when entered
	- UPDATED: Saved Presets can now be deleted directly from the UI (Right-Click in Load Dropdown to delete, no need to use chat commands now)
	- CHANGED: Spawn is now in Object section; Revised Movement button placements
	- CHANGED: Added a "Classic Layout" button in Movement to revert the movement buttons to closer to the original layout
	- REMOVED: Double & Halve checkboxes. 
		- You can still use the Double (x2) and Halve (1/2) buttons to change each dimension, or SHIFT-CLICK them to update all dimensions together.
	Behind the Scenes:
	- Minimap Icon is better and more adaptable to if you use other minimaps / UI's
	- Improved ToolTips & UI Indications when things are disabled
	- Improved Slider Logic
	- Keybindings are sorted into their own category to be easier to find

----------------------------------------

v6.0.0 (March 21, 2020)
	- Auto Update Rot. finished and activated  (note: ".go pitch/roll/turn" will be off until the next server mini-update due to syntax issues in the old reply - it will automatically work perfect once the server updates to the new command syntax!)
	- Major restructure of the ChatFilter to clean it up. It should be way more reliable. No more "My commands aren't showing in chat anymore wtf?" hopefully.
	- Move Relative now uses the server commands for best performance
	- More Cowbell

----------------------------------------

v5.0.0 (September 21, 2017)
	- New: Move Relative option - When on, moves the object relative to your current orientation, not the objects. (I.e., object is facing east, you're facing north - 'forward' will move the object north, not east). Credits to shadowbunny88 for the initial idea and code.
	- New: Save / Load Preset Systems for Object Parameters and Rotations.
	- New: Apply rotation button! No longer need to move sliders around to apply rotation to a new object.
	- New: Hover your Mouse over almost any Text EditBox / CheckBox / Button for more details on it's function or usage.
	- New: Half / Double buttons per-dimension & scale. These are not dynamic and just update the box completely. Works alongside dynamic Double and Halve options still.
	- Added: Ability to set Key Bindings for toggling Move Object and Move Relative Options
	- Added: Lock Frame button besides the close button - When enabled, the frame cannot be moved.
	- Changed: Default 'Step' for Sliders is now in Whole Numbers (Use SHIFT or ALT modifiers to get decimal points), text-entry will auto-round to 4 decimal places.
	- Changed / Fixed: Scale will now wait 0.5 seconds before setting to avoid a server bug with scales set at same time as spawn not saving.
	- Fixed: Bindings for Halve / Bifold toggle.
	- Fixed: Options set via Binding not saving.
	- Fixed: Scale CheckButton un-checking if you are entering a new scale (now only disables the box when an invalid scale is present, re-enables when valid)
	- Not-Fixed: Compatibility with WIM (chat filter counting) (WIM Breaks everything. Don't use it.)
	- WIP: Auto Update Rot. - Button is added but non-functional as there's no feasible way to get the information needed from the server currently.

	
----------------------------------------

v4.2.0 (Aug 17, 2017)
	- Fixed Up / Down not working until Forward / Back was used once
	- Fixed Up / Down not using the correct number (again, sorry - ACTUALLY FIXED NOW!)
	- Changed saved variables into a table instead of a different saved variable for each one - allows new variables to be added on the fly, and provided some work on using tables and how they work so I can try and make auto-dimensions work later.
	- (b) Fixed a removed function being called, resulting in a Lua Error.

----------------------------------------

v4.1.1 (Aug 7, 2017)
	- Fixed Left / Right & Up / Down using their correct numbers instead of just always using the Length Value. Oops..
	- Introduced Temporary Rotation Step Increment Modifiers: Hold Shift to snap to full degrees, alt to snap to 0.1 degrees, both Alt+Shift to snap to every 5 degrees. Default without any modifiers is still 0.01 degrees.

----------------------------------------

v4.0.0 (Aug 5, 2017)
	- Remade all movement functions to utilize ".gps <dir> <unit>".
	- Remade Chat Clarifiers to filter and gather data from chat messages.
	- Removed old deprecated functions and options (i.e., Save on Spawn)
	- Remade entire double, half, and scale modifiers for movement.
	- Expanded to include "Move Object" instead
	- Expanded to include new GObject Rotation sliders.
	- Saved Variables to recall what options and settings you had from last login.
	- Redid UI Color / Transparency / Lightness
	- Made UI Moveable.
	- Made Minimap Button Save position
	- Attempted to start Auto Dimensions System, TBD Later if it'll come to fruition.
	- Changed Keybindings to utilize data validation on object parameters.
